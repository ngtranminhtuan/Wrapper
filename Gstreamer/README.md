I think you are familiar with gstreamer. GStreamer is a pipeline-based multimedia framework written in the C programming language with the type system based on GObject.using this library we can develop any type of streaming multi media application; it handles both audio and video. see the wiki link for more details:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GStreamer

In my recent project I had to use it; I have written a object oriented C++ wrapper for it .here I have shared it.
Following class diagram shows how you can use it.
